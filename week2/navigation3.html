        <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>
        <p>Environmental Politics is an international, multi-disciplinary, peer-reviewed journal, which provides a forum for the publication of original research into, and discussion and analysis of, the diverse theoretical and empirical aspects of environmental politics. We understand environmental politics very broadly. It includes the multiple ways in which diverse and potentially competing interests and ideas influence how different groups in society value, use, manage, interact with, care about, or seek to regulate the environment. It is primarily concerned with scholarship focusing on: political parties, private actors, NGOs, social movements, and campaigns; the design, negotiation, and implementation of environmental policy; and environmental political thought. The journal also explores the ideas generated by environmental groups and other organizations that underpin policy and governance, and critically and normatively examines environmental concerns.

            Environmental Politics is open to the use of a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to studying environmental politics, and welcomes submissions on the politics of global, national, and local scales of action and meaning, as well as international environmental issues in all parts of the world. All submissions should make clear the implications of their findings for environmental politics more broadly.
            
            All submitted manuscripts are subject to initial appraisal by the Editors, and, if found suitable for further consideration, to anonymous (double anonymized) peer review by reviewers with appropriate expertise. Book Review Essays, Discussions, and Introductions are subject to peer review and/or reviewed by members of the editorial team.
            
            Authors can choose to publish gold open access in this journal.
            
            Read the Instructions for Authors for information on how to submit your article.
